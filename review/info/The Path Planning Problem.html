<h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000"></a>The Path Planning Problem</h1>

<p><a name="problem"></a>&nbsp; Many versions of the path planning problem
exist. An exhaustive classification of these problems and of the methods
developed to solve them can be found in a survey by Hwang and Ahuja&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Hwang">1992</a>].
We choose to illustrate our discussion with a particular case. A robot
arm is placed among a set of obstacles. Given an initial and a final position
of the robot arm, the problem is to find a set of motions that will lead
the robot to move between the two positions without colliding with the
obstacles. </p>

<p>To drive the robot amidst the obstacles, early methods&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#brooks">Brooks
1983</a>] directly used the 3<font size="-2">D</font> <font size="-2">CAD</font>
models of the robot and of the obstacles to find a solution, i.e., they
considered the ``operational 3<font size="-2">D</font> space''. In this space,
the path planning problem consists of finding the movements of a complex
3<font size="-2">D</font> structure (the robot) in a cluttered 3<font size="-2">D</font>
space. </p>

<p>A major advance was to express the problem in another space known as
the configuration space, denoted by <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img1.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1298" height="14" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Lozano87">Lozano-Pérez 1987</a>]. In
this space, the position (or configuration) of a robot is completely determined
by a single point having <i>n</i> independent parameters as coordinates.
The positions that are not physically legal (because of a collision) are
represented by particular regions of <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img1.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1298" height="14" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
, and are called <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img7.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1322" height="14" width="86" align="BOTTOM">
. In the configuration space, the path planning problem consists of finding
a continuous curve (representing a path for a single geometrical point)
that (i) connects the points representing the initial and the final configuration
of the robot, and (ii) does not intersect any <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img7.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1322" height="14" width="86" align="BOTTOM">
. This method trades a simplification of the path planning problem (it
searches a path for a single point) against a higher-dimensional search
space (the dimension of <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img1.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1298" height="14" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
is the number <font size="-2">DOF</font> of the robot) and against more complex
shapes of obstacles (very simple physical obstacles may result in very
complex <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img7.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1322" height="14" width="86" align="BOTTOM">
). </p>

<p>For example, let us consider the planar arm of Figure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node2.html#figwork_sp">1</a>.
Its position among the obstacles is totally known once the values of the
angles between its links <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img8.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1330" height="29" width="52" align="CENTER">
are known. Thus, for each pair <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img8.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1330" height="29" width="52" align="CENTER">
, it is possible to decide whether the robot collides with the surrounding
obstacles. This is what we did in Figure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node2.html#figCB_obst">2</a>
to represent the mapping between the physical obstacles in the operational
space and the <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img7.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1322" height="14" width="86" align="BOTTOM">
. Now, by moving a point along the curve joining <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img9.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1336" height="25" width="14" align="CENTER">
and <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img10.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1338" height="26" width="14" align="CENTER">
one will also define a collision-free motion for the planar arm between
the corresponding positions <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img11.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1340" height="29" width="43" align="CENTER">
and <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img12.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1342" height="29" width="43" align="CENTER">
in the operational space. This curve is one solution to this particular
path planning problem. </p>

<p>A recent trend in the field is to consider the ``trajectory space''&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#ferbach">Ferbach
1996</a>] where a whole path is represented by a single point. The coordinates
of this point are the values of the parameters defining the successive
movements of the robot. For instance, the list of successive commands sent
to the robot controller indeed encode an entire path of the robot. In this
space, the path planning problem is reduced to the search for a single
point. Once again, we trade a simplification of the path planning problem
(searching for a point) against a higher dimension of the search space
(the dimension of the trajectory space is the number of parameters needed
to specify completely a whole path). For example, in Figure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node2.html#figCB_obst">2</a>,
the path between <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img13.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1344" height="25" width="12" align="CENTER">
and <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img14.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1346" height="25" width="14" align="CENTER">
can be represented by a point in a seven-dimensional space simply by considering
the length of its seven segments. </p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"></a>Global Approaches</h2>

<p>Global approaches are classically divided into two main classes: (i)
retraction methods, and (ii) decomposition methods. In the retraction methods,
one tries to reduce the dimension of the initial problem by recursively
considering sub-manifolds of the configuration space. In the decomposition
methods, one tries to characterize the regions of the configuration space
that are free of obstacles. Both methods end up with a classical graph
search over a discrete space. In principle, these methods are <i>complete</i>
because they will find a path if one exists and will still terminate in
a finite time if a path does not exist. Unfortunately, computing the retraction
or the decomposition graph is an <font size="-2">NP</font>-complete problem:
the complexity of this task grows exponentially as the number of <font size="-2">DOF</font>
increases&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#canny">Canny 1988</a>]. Consequently,
these planners are used only for robots having a limited number (three
or four) of <font size="-2">DOF</font>. In addition, they are slow and can
only be used off-line: the planner is invoked with a model of the environment,
it produces a plan that is passed to the robot controller which, in turn,
executes it. In general, the time necessary to achieve this is not short
enough to allow the robot to move in a dynamic environment. </p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00022000000000000000"></a>Path Planning with Local
Planners</h2>

<p>One way to combat the complexity of the problem is to trade completeness
against performance. To do this, the local planners are guided by the gradient
of a cost function (usually the Euclidean distance to the goal) and take
into account the constraints introduced by the obstacles to avoid them&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Fav87">Faverjon
Tournassoud 1987</a>]. Since the path planning problem is <font size="-2">NP</font>-complete,
knowing the cost function, it is always possible to design a deceptive
environment where the method will get trapped in a local minimum. However,
these methods are useful in many industrial applications because they can
deal with complex robots and environment models having thousands of faces,
that are often too time-consuming for global methods. </p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00023000000000000000"></a>Path Planning with Randomized
Techniques and Landmarks</h2>

<p>The stochastic or random approach was first introduced by Barraquand
and Latombe&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Barraquand90">1990</a>], and later
used by Overmars&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Overmars92">1992</a>], and more
recently by Kavraki&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#kavraki">1996</a>]. The main
idea behind these algorithms is to build a graph in the configuration space.
The graph is obtained incrementally as follows: a local planner is used
to try to reach the goal. Should the motion stop at a local minimum, a
new node (or landmark) is created by generating a random motion starting
from that local minimum. The method iterates these two steps until the
goal configuration has been reached from one of these intermediary positions
by a gradient descent motion. These algorithms work with a discretized
representation of the configuration space. They are known to be <i>probabilistically
complete</i> because the probability of terminating with a solution (a
path has been found or no path exists) converges to one as the allowed
time increase towards infinity. As in the previous section, it is also
possible to design simple deceptive environments that will make this kind
of algorithm slower than a pure random approach. However, they have been
tested for robots with a high number of <font size="-2">DOF</font> and they
have been shown to work quickly in relatively complex and natural environments.
</p>

<p>Other methods using landmarks have been devised. For example, <font size="-2">SANDROS</font>,
introduced by Chen and Hwang[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#Hwang">Hwang 1992</a>],
makes use of landmarks to approximate the free space. This approach is
similar to the ``hierarchical planning'' approach used in <font size="-2">AI</font>:
should the method fail to reach a goal, new subgoals are generated until
the problem is easy enough to be solved. In their approach, first a local
planner is used to reach the final position: should the local planner fail,
the configuration space is divided into two subspaces, one containing the
goal and the other a new sub-goal. The problem is therefore divided into
two sub-problems: (i) going from the initial position to the subgoal, and
(ii) going from the subgoal to the final position. <font size="-2">SANDROS</font>
has been shown to be particularly well adapted to find paths for manipulators.
It has been implemented and tested for planning paths for Puma and Adept
robots. </p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00024000000000000000"></a>Path Planning in the Trajectory
Space</h2>

<p>The previous methods were essentially based on the configuration space:
the retraction, the decomposition, or the optimization is made in this
space. An alternative is to consider the ``trajectory space''. For example,
in his method <font size="-2">VDP</font>, Ferbach&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#ferbach">Ferbach
1996</a>] starts by considering the straight line segment joining the initial
and the final configuration in <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img1.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1298" height="14" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
. This path is progressively modified in such a manner that the forbidden
regions it crosses are reduced. At each iteration, a sub-manifold of <img src="./The Path Planning Problem_files/img1.gif" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline1298" height="14" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
containing the current path is randomly generated. It is then discretized
and explored using a dynamic programming method that uses the length across
the forbidden region as the cost function in order to minimize. The search
results in a new trajectory whose intersection with the forbidden regions
is smaller than the original trajectory. The process is repeated until
an admissible trajectory is found. As in the previous sections, it is also
possible to design simple deceptive environments that will make this kind
of algorithm slower than a pure random approach. </p>

<p>The work of Lin, Xiao, and Michalewicz&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#xiao94">1994</a>]
is similar to our approach. As in an early version of our algorithm&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#jma92">Ahuactzin,
Mazer, Bessière, Talbi 1992</a>], genetic algorithms are used to
carry out optimization in the trajectory space. Trajectories are parameterized
using the coordinates of intermediary via-points. An evolutionary algorithm
is used to optimize a cost function based on the length of the trajectory
and the forbidden region crossed. The standard operators of the genetic
algorithms have been modified and later extended to produce a large variety
of paths&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume9/mazer98a-html/node6.html#xiao96">Xiao, Michalewicz, Zhang 1996</a>].
The number of intermediary via-points is fixed and chosen using an heuristic.
Given this number, nothing prevents to design a deceptive problem which
solution will require more intermediary points, leading the algorithm to
fail while one solution exists. </p>
